## Advanced Web Security Testing Tool

**Author:** SayerLinux  
**Email:** SayerLinux1@gmail.com  
**Version:** 1.0.0  

## Overview

Zero is a comprehensive web security testing framework designed to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. It provides advanced scanning capabilities for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, hidden file discovery, and firewall bypass mechanisms.

## Features

### üîç Vulnerability Detection
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Tests for various SQL injection vectors including blind injection
- **XSS Scanner**: Identifies cross-site scripting vulnerabilities (Reflected & Stored)
- **CSRF Testing**: Detects missing CSRF tokens in forms
- **Database Exploitation**: Extracts database credentials and configuration files

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Capabilities
- **Firewall Bypass**: Attempts to bypass WAF protections using various headers
- **Hidden File Discovery**: Discovers sensitive files and directories
- **Zero-Day Detection Framework**: Basic framework for identifying vulnerable components
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed JSON reports with findings

### üìä Reporting
- Real-time vulnerability detection
- Detailed JSON reports with timestamps
- Evidence-based vulnerability classification
- Hidden file discovery results
- Database credential extraction

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/SaudiLinux/Zero.git
cd Zero

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python Zero.py <target_url>
```

### Examples
```bash
# Scan a single website
python Zero.py https://example.com

# Scan with IP address
python Zero.py 192.168.1.100

# Scan local development site
python Zero.py http://localhost:8080
```

### Command Line Options
The tool accepts a single argument - the target URL to scan.

## Scanning Process

1. **Initial Setup**: Target URL validation and session initialization
2. **Firewall Bypass**: Attempts to bypass WAF protections
3. **Hidden File Discovery**: Searches for sensitive files and directories
4. **SQL Injection Testing**: Tests for SQL injection vulnerabilities
5. **XSS Testing**: Identifies cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
6. **CSRF Testing**: Detects missing CSRF protection
7. **Database Information Extraction**: Attempts to extract database credentials
8. **Zero-Day Detection**: Identifies potentially vulnerable components
9. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive JSON report

## Output Files

### Report Structure
Each scan generates a JSON report file with the following format:
```json
{
  "target": "https://example.com",
  "scan_date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "type": "SQL Injection",
      "url": "https://example.com/login.php",
      "method": "post",
      "payload": "' OR 1=1--",
      "evidence": "SQL error message detected"
    }
  ],
  "hidden_files": [
    "https://example.com/admin.php",
    "https://example.com/.env"
  ],
  "database_credentials": [...],
  "firewall_bypassed": true,
  "total_vulnerabilities": 5
}
```

## Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Educational Use Only**: This tool is intended for authorized security testing
- **Legal Compliance**: Always obtain proper authorization before scanning
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through appropriate channels
- **Rate Limiting**: The tool includes delays to prevent overwhelming target servers

### Ethical Guidelines
- Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Do not use for malicious purposes
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Respect robots.txt and terms of service

## Technical Details

### Vulnerability Detection Methods

#### SQL Injection
- Error-based SQL injection testing
- Union-based SQL injection attempts
- Boolean-based blind SQL injection
- Time-based blind SQL injection

#### XSS Detection
- Reflected XSS testing in URL parameters
- Stored XSS testing in form inputs
- DOM-based XSS detection
- Script injection attempts

#### CSRF Testing
- Form token validation
- Missing CSRF token detection
- Cross-origin request validation

#### Hidden File Discovery
- Common sensitive file paths
- Backup file detection
- Configuration file discovery
- Administrative interface detection

### Firewall Bypass Techniques
- IP spoofing headers
- User-Agent rotation
- Header manipulation
- Rate limiting evasion

## Changelog

### Version 1.0.0 (Initial Release)
- Basic vulnerability scanning framework
- SQL injection detection
- XSS vulnerability testing
- CSRF protection testing
- Hidden file discovery
- Firewall bypass mechanisms
- Database credential extraction
- JSON report generation
- Real-time vulnerability detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **SSL Certificate Errors**: The tool disables SSL verification for testing purposes
2. **Connection Timeouts**: Increase timeout values in the configuration
3. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays help prevent IP blocking
4. **False Positives**: Manual verification recommended for all findings

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust thread pool size for concurrent scanning
- Modify timeout values based on network conditions
- Use proxy settings for anonymous testing
- Configure custom headers for specific environments

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced payload databases
